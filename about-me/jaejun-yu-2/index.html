The first one of the series was published in Phys. Rev. Lett. (1987) (cited more than 720 times) with Prof. A. J. Freeman at Northwestern University, which is one of the first reports on the electronic structure theory of high <i>T</i><span class="s1"><sub>c</sub></span> Cu-oxides, uncovering the 2D nature of the band structure arising from the strong hybridization of Cu d and O p orbitals within the 2D square lattice of the Cu-O layer and became a solid standard of following electronic structure calculations. Later, his research evolved by building on DFT (density functional theory) calculations and elaborating model analyses for the physical properties of real materials. He has made numerous contributions to understanding novel transition metal oxides and compounds based on the DFT works. After high <i>T</i><span class="s1"><sub>c</sub></span> cuprates, he continued his research on related transition metal oxide materials, including CMR (colossal magnetoresistance) manganese oxide and associated compounds, heterostructures, and superlattices of transition metal oxides. He extended his scope to the system with orbital degrees of freedom, competing with effective spin interactions and understanding spin and orbital orderings and results of optical spectroscopy in collaboration with experimental groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He recently explored several oxide superlattices and clarified the role of oxygen vacancies in generating charge carriers at the interface of LaAlO<span class="s1"><sub>3</sub></span> overlays on the SrTiO<span class="s1"><sub>3</sub></span> (001) surface. Further, he searched for a new type of oxide semiconductors with <i>p</i>-type carriers, e.g., BaSnO<span class="s1"><sub>3</sub></span>. He investigated the role of defects in various oxide materials with applications to electronic devices and catalysts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p><p class="p2"><strong><i>J</i></strong><span class="s2"><strong><sub>eff</sub></strong></span><strong>=1/2 physics.</strong> Gaining experience in 3<i>d</i> transition metal oxides, he looked into the physics of 4<i>d</i> and 5<i>d</i> transition metal oxides, where the spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) interactions become significant and can play a crucial role in determining their electronic and magnetic properties. While moving from 3<i>d</i> to 4<i>d</i> and 5<i>d</i> metal oxides, the bandwidth gets broadened, and the strength of on-site Coulomb interactions becomes relatively weaker. Thus, in contrast to the insulating ground state of its 3<i>d</i> oxides, it is natural to expect a metallic ground state for the 4<i>d</i> and 5<i>d</i> compounds. To one’s surprise, Sr<span class="s1"><sub>2</sub></span>IrO<span class="s1"><sub>4</sub></span> was reported to be insulating with an optical gap of about 0.5 eV, contrary to the metallic Sr<span class="s1"><sub>2</sub></span>RhO<span class="s1"><sub>4</sub></span> of its 4<i>d</i> counterpart. Indeed, it remained a puzzle until he came up with a solution that the SOC combined with a moderate on-site Coulomb interaction can give rise to a new kind of entangled quantum state manifesting the spin-orbit coupled <i>J</i>-state with an effective angular momentum of <i>J</i><span class="s1"><sub>eff</sub></span>=1/2. The idea of <i>J</i><span class="s1"><sub>eff</sub></span>=1/2 was first suggested in his seminal paper on Phys. Rev. Lett. (2008) (cited more than 1,550 times) has significantly influenced various aspects of correlated electron physics with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, such as superconductivity, quantum magnetism, topological insulators, metal-insulator transition, and so on. Recently, by expanding the idea of the spin-orbit coupled state, he has proposed that a (111)-oriented BaBiO<span class="s1"><sub>3</sub></span> bilayer sandwiched between large-gap perovskite oxides is a promising candidate for topological electronics by realizing a gap-tunable and topology-tunable system, enabling the switch between quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall phases.</p><p class="p2"><strong>2D materials.</strong> Magnetism in 2D materials has attracted much interest due to its potential applications to spintronics and nano-electronic devices. He has made interesting observations on atomically thin materials' charge and magnetic states during the last decade, primarily in graphene and single-layer boron nitride (BN) systems. One of his early works on graphene nanoribbon revealed the formation of local moments and their interactions at the edge of graphitic fragments—this work was published in Phys. Rev. B (2005) (cited more than 520 times) has provided a clear and lucid picture of the magnetic edge states, consequently leading to enormous activities for possible manipulation of ferromagnetic edge states for their potential applications. He has recently proposed that the charge and magnetic conditions of the transition-metal adatom on graphene or single-layer BN can be effectively controlled by either defects or external electric fields. </p><p class="p2"><strong>DFT code (OpenMX) project.</strong> <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In collaboration with Prof. Taisuke Ozaki at ISSP, the University of Tokyo, he has been actively involved in the development of the DFT code called OpenMX (Open source package for Material eXplorer; <a href="http://www.openmx-square.org">http://www.openmx-square.org</a>), which is a software package for nano-scale material simulations based on DFT, aiming for the realization of large-scale <i>ab initio</i> electronic structure calculations. Indeed, the early development of non-collinear spin DFT code within OpenMX, incorporating both spin-orbit coupling and LDA+U, made it possible to discover the <i>J</i><span class="s1"><sub>eff</sub></span> = 1/2 state in Sr<span class="s1"><sub>2</sub></span>IrO<span class="s1"><sub>4</sub></span> Ir oxides. Taking advantage of its local orbital basis formulation, he developed an approach to derive effective Hamiltonians based on Wannier functions derived from DFT calculations. He utilizes this approach to analyze various materials' topological band structure and magnetism.</p><h5 class="p3">Selected List of Conference Activities</h5><ul class="ul1"><li class="li4">Asian Workshop on First-Principles Electronic Structure Calculations, 1998 - present,<br>serving for 19 years as a core member of the International Organizing Committee, contributing to the DFT community in east Asian countries for the computational condensed matter physics and materials sciences. </li><li class="li4">Korea-Japan-Taiwan Symposium on Strongly Correlated Electron Systems, 2000 - present,<br>serving for 17 years as a core member of the International Organizing Committee, contributing to promoting strongly correlated electron physics in the physics community in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.</li><li class="li4">APCTP-IACS (Korea-India) Joint Symposium on Emergent Phenomena in Novel Oxide Materials and Low Dimensional Systems, 2008 - present,<br>serving for 14 years as a convener of the bilateral symposium to promote scientific activities and exchange programs among the physics communities of Korea and India. </li><li class="li4">APCTP-QMS (Quantum Materials Symposium), 2014 - present<br>serving as a core member of the Organizing Committee and now as an organizing chair contributing to the condensed matter physics community, especially of strongly correlated electron materials, in Korea.</li><li class="li4">International Conference on Strongly Correlated Electron Systems (SCES) 2023, 2022 - 2023, serving as a co-chair of the Conference, which will be held in Incheon, Korea, from 2nd to 7th July 2023. </li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">© 2024 Jaejun Yu</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://jyusnu.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
